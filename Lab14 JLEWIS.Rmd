## SCIENCE RULES!

This is a slide where I say that science **rules**!

## Why science rules

- It's fun
- You feel like a detective
- Sometimes it involves fire or chemicals or other weird things


## My favorite types of things to study with science

- Rocks
- Animals
- Humans
- Plants


## The End

Wahoo!!!
